## In this project i will prepare storage infrastructure on two Linux servers and implement a basic web solution using WordPress


I will configure storage subsystem for Web and Database servers based on Linux OS. Also demonstrate the process of working with disks, partitions and volumes in Linux.

I will install WordPress and connect it to a remote MySQL database server, while deploying Web and DB tiers of Web solution.

I will be using RedHat OS
